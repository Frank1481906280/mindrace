This is a tiny program to serve as an example for using the MindWave Mobile
device from Linux to mind-control a robot. The program outputs a stream of
"r" (right), "l" (left), "s" (straight) and "e" (error) characters to
stdout. These characters can be used to change the orientation of a robotic
vehicle moving at a constant speed.
